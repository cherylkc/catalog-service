# Tutorial: Fetching a book using any of its properties

Say you're a Wordhoard user trying to recommend a book to a friend. You don't recall the title of the book or the exact spelling of the author's name, but you do remember that you received the book as a gift for your birthday during the pandemic. Wordhoard can help you out by letting you retrieve the name of the book using the month and year (April 2020) as a query parameter.

The following tutorial shows you how to do that - retrieve `books` that match a specified property from your Wordhoard collection. This involves making a `GET` request to the appropriate endpoint using any of the following query parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `title` | string | The title or short description of the book |
| `author` | string | The author or writer of the book |
| `genre` | string | The literary genre or category that the book belongs to |
| `keyword` | string | An informative word used to indicate a key feature of the book |
| `month_year_added`  | string | The month and year the book was added to the collection or received as a gift |

## Before you start

* Make sure you have the following on your system:
  * A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and a fork of the [Wordhoard repository](https://github.com/cherylkc/catalog-service.git) cloned to your desktop
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
  * [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)
  * [Postmanâ€™s Desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
  * Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS)

* Open [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and make sure the current repository is **catalog-service**.
  * Create a new test branch.
  * Go to **Repository > Open in Command Prompt**.
  * In the Command Prompt window, run `cd api database`
  * Now run the command `json-server -w catalog-database.json`

Your service is now ready for HTTP requests.

## Fetching a book using a property

To retrieve a book in your collection, send a `GET` request to the service.

1. Open the Postman desktop app.
2. Create a new HTTP request with these values:

* **Method**: GET
* **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/books`
* **Query params**:
  * Key: month_year_added
  * Value: April 2020
* **Headers** (optional):
  * Key: Content-Type
  * Value: application/json
* **Request body**: None

Click **Send** to make the request.

A successful request will return a list of books that match the specified property. If no books match the specified property, you will receive an empty list. For this example, a succesful response looks like this:

```js
[
    {
        "user_id": 1,
        "title": "What if? 2: Additional Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions",
        "author": "Randall Munroe",
        "genre": "Nonfiction",
        "keyword": "popular science",
        "month_year_added": "April 2020",
        "id": 3
    },
    {
        "user_id": 1,
        "title": "At the Feet of the Sun",
        "author": "Victoria Goddard",
        "genre": "Fantasy",
        "keyword": "softcover",
        "month_year_added": "April 2020",
        "id": 4
    }
]
```

You can now try fetching books using another property if you'd like to play around a bit more with this. This functionality allows you to efficiently search for and retrieve books based on specific criteria, making it easier to manage and organize your collection.
