# Wordhoard

Ever wished you could pull up a list of all the books you own, while browsing at a bookstore or looking at a deal on an interesting book online? The Wordhoard REST API lets your customers do that and more, effortlessly. Within the API, users can search for books by title, author, genre, or keyword, and avoid accidentally buying multiple copies of the same book.

You do not need an API key to use our service. The API uses JSON to encode objects and relies on standard HTTP requests to manage `users` and `books`. It can even be integrated with online bookstores and public libraries to help drive purchasing decisions.

## Get started

> Set up your development environment using our Before you start tutorial (*coming soon*) to get the best results from the service.

Check out our Quickstart guide (*coming soon*) to see how you can help your customers create their very own digital bookshelf!
